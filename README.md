explodinghat's blog

This is the repo that underpins the explodinghat blog. I am trying to be as transparent about any bugs and issues I encounter, both in creating and hosting content, and also in work related to blog articles.

The site was created from a template by Chad Baldwin via [this guide](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) so if you want to create your own please do (and give credit where it's due!)

Where possible, I'll attempt to add links to the repos that back content on the site, so please take a look at my GitHub repos for this. I am planning to keep tabs on issues via the 'issues' feature in GitHub, so feel free to look at previous issues if you want a glimpse 'behind the scenes'. Also if something isn't working, please raise a new issue!

Blog and content should be available [here](https://explodinghat.github.io)

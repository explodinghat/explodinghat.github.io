# The portfolio

So if you visit my github you will be able to see my modest portfolio of work from the last few years. 
There's not a huge amount in there, but you will see evidence covering C, Powershell and Python from a variety of online courses, textbooks and some real-world solutions to issues I've uncovered in my day job(s). 
The plan, much like with this blog, is to keep this updated as a companion piece. You should hopefully be able to visit the site mattwarren.co.uk and be able to gather an overall picture of what I am working on, what I have worked on and what interests me.
